Tripowin has had all the success in designing functional cables that are aesthetically pleasing and high in purity. These days, cable manufacturers are creating IEM cables with replaceable plug terminations. Tripowin taking cues had developed the Tripowin Petrichor, which garnered all the success. It was designed to be functional and aesthetically eye-catching. Building on the same philosophy, Tripowin is proud to introduce the all-new Amber cable with interchangeable plug terminations. Named after Amber, the new Tripowin multifunctional cable Amber joined the family with its innovative design, the same as Tripowin Noire.

**My first Balanced cable**

I ordered this with a Moondrop Chu. Combined with this cable and my Shaling UA2 DAC or certainly did felt different than what I used to hear until now, the sound stage certainly widened and the nuances highlighted, the bass was punchier as well. Overall good change, certainly worth the money.

**Tripowin Amber: A Cable That’s as Stunning as It is Premium!**

Ever since the Headphone Zone gurus recommended this cable, I knew I had to get my hands on it. The moment I finally did, I couldn't stop smiling! The Tripowin Amber is an absolute stunner—it looked gorgeous in the website photos, but in person, it’s even better. The build quality is top-notch, exuding pure premium vibes. It's incredibly soft, unlike those stiff, annoying IEM cables, making it a dream to handle.

The real showstopper? The modular termination and that breathtaking color! I’ve paired it with my Simgot EW300 x HBB, and wow—it's a match made in heaven. The fit is flawless, and the colors complement each other so perfectly that it takes the whole setup to another level.

Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to leave such a lovely review for the Tripowin Amber. Happy listening!

**Amber**

The cable as in doesn't change the sound of your IEM but it improves the sound stage a bit..... Now if you ask me why Amber and not zonie? Here's a simple answer.... Modulation flexibility.... I have tried the zonie previously from my friend and it's almost the same.... The zonie doesn't have that....   
Cons: The two pin terminals can be a bit loose for some IEMs but that's totally manageable.....   
Pros: Why even waste time talking about pros..... It's known to all that upgrade cables are mostly better than the one that comes with the IEMs.... If taken care it will last us a life time.....   
Thank you headphone zone for being so much active in the Indian audiophile community.... I hope people understand the fact that bluetooth wireless earbuds aren't effective in terms of sound quality.... Be a music lover, musician, audiophile or sound engineer, wireless is just convenience.....

****

Thank you for such an in-depth and thoughtful review! Your insights are incredibly valuable and will surely help other audiophiles make informed decisions.

**Versatile**

The Tripowin Amber is basically a Tripowin Zonie with modular plug ends at a fair price. I wish it came in more colors!

**This will serve me good for years to come**

Let's be clear about one thing. The cables themselves don't alter the sound in any way. (If otherwise, then u must be doing something wrong).

With that being said, there IS an incentive to "buy" an upgrade cable: 1) being able to use the Bal channels on your dac, 2) benifits of having interchangeable plugs, 3) Looks and sturdiness (which would ALWAYS be better than your stock cables).

The Amber checked all these boxes. And there is, technically speaking, no reason to get a 50k rs cable. In other words, other than looks, there is nothing a 50k rs cable can do that tripowin Amber can't. (Believe what u want, but that doesn't make it true).

Thank you for taking the time to leave a review for the Tripowin - Amber.

**Pretty good tangle free cable**

It's pretty good quality for the price, modular and neutral. What's not to like ?

**Feels premium and sounds premium**

My stock cable of Moondrop Aria 2021 broke so I ordered this one. I must say that I can easily notice the sound difference over my stock. The sound is more crisp and clear, the imagining is slightly improved and the bass now feels tighter. However i feel that the soundstage is now a bit narrow (I could be wrong). I’m using this with apple dongle and as compared to the stock cable of aria, this sounds more fuller giving more energy to IEM which made me realise that i was missing something with the stock cable. I’m curious how this will perform with 4.4mm balanced dac as I’m eagerly waiting for the Onix Alpla Xl1 :)

2/5 for the delivery as this time the delivery was pretty late. I had placed order on 12th September in the morning and received it on 18th.

**The right first cable**

Hi , was lucky enough to own the tripowin amber and I am enjoying it very much so the cable has no memory. And no distortion in sound even when I paired it with a sensitive iem and a good dac   
All in all a very good buy.

**Great cable all in all**

Ridiculously soft, doesn't tangle as much, and gives you that premium cable feel
