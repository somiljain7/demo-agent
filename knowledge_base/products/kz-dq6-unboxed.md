DELIVERY

CHANGE

Dispatches in  **3-4 days**

###### What does "ships within 24/48 hours" mean?

In a nutshell, ships within 24/48 hours basically means that your product will be shipped out or dispatched from our warehouse within 24/48 hours after placing the order. It also indicates that the products are readily available at our warehouse and once we receive your order, we dispatch it out at the earliest either on the same day or the next working day depending on when you’ve placed your order.

  

###### What it does not mean:

A lot of our customers assume that it means their order will get delivered to them within 24/48 hours, but that’s not what it means. For an order to reach you, it can take anywhere up to 3-4 business days, depending on which part of India you are placing an order from.   
  
For an accurate timeline, you can enter your pin code on the product page and check for an estimated date of arrival.

Cables 

###### Replaceable Cables

A pair of headphones with a replaceable cable has many benefits, and one of them is if the connecting cable has a problem, it doesn’t mean that you have to buy a new one. If the connecting cable gets pulled or damaged, you can replace it and keep using your good-old headphones or IEMs. This way, your headphones will be protected and will last longer. With the advancements in cable manufacturing, you now get a variety of replacement cables with various termination options, lengths and quality.

  

Tangle-Free  
Cables 

###### Tangle-Free Cables

Every time you reach for earphone/IEM cables to connect them to your earphones/IEM, no matter how neatly you "wrapped" them up, they end up in a giant Gordian knot of frustration. Tangled cables are the bane of modern existence, and everyone owning a wired pair of earphones/IEM can attest to this. 

  

With advances in cable-making techniques and radical approaches to manufacturing, there are now several solutions to this universal problem. **You get Flat cables, Mesh Design cables, cables coated with exterior covers and cables designed with a zipper style design** to avoid Tangle and attempt to solve the issue.
