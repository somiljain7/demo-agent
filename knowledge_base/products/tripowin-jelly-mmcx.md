Aalap (Hyderabad) 

**One of the best**

The cable is very soft with no microphonics and the quality is very superior. I have the Truthear Zero Red, and I put these cables with it. The cable is very soft and you can feel the quality and the 3.5 mm end is also a high quality one.

Cable is of good quality and sounds good too. Couldn't compare it with anything else as the standard iem cable was single ended with 3.5 termination.

Hey Vipin, thank you so much for this lovely review and we are glad that you are enjoying it!

**Excellent product**

I wanted a replacement cable for my Final A3000 and this fits like a glove. The cable quality is excellent but, there isn't visible improvement in sound

**Mmcx 4.4**

So flowy and soft. Sound is too much improved compared to 3.5 mm. Value for money

**Cable with really HiFi performance at affordable price**

Tripowin jelly cable is perfect for those who are looking for stellar performance at affordable price. Cable termination seems rigid and well built. Cable is super soft with no cable noise, a very nice treatment so far the cables I came across.

The thickness was more than what I expected, Loved the quality.. they do tend to get tangle but not really a major dealbreaker.
