🌟 An Amp & DAC Specialist

###### 🌟 Specialist

  

A masterpiece from experts who know audio inside and out 🔧!

  

I tend to describe specialist manufacturers as "audio artisans" who focus exclusively on perfecting specific categories of equipment. These products are meticulously crafted by dedicated experts who possess deep knowledge of sound reproduction, ensuring every technical aspect is refined to perfection. Think of them like master craftsmen who spend their entire careers perfecting one specific skill - their focused expertise shows in every detail.

  

These dedicated experts bring years of specialised knowledge to the design process, resulting in products that consistently achieve exceptional performance standards through focused engineering excellence 🎯.

  

When you see "🌟 Specialist" products, expect focused expertise from manufacturers who dedicate their entire efforts to perfecting specific audio equipment categories.

🐣 Born in 2012

Why we love this DAC/Amp

🥜 Value for Money

###### 🥜 Value for Money

  

I've found that the best gear isn’t always the most expensive. Some products punch well above their weight and deliver performance that rivals higher-priced alternatives. That’s what we mean with the "Value for Money" badge. It’s our way of telling you that you’re getting something special without breaking the bank. 🥜

  

These products are all about maximum returns for minimal investment. You’re not just saving money — you’re gaining an audio experience that exceeds expectations. Whether it’s build quality, tuning, or bundled accessories, these picks overdeliver.

  

When you see '🥜 Value for Money' products, expect impressive performance at an affordable price, making them a smart pick for budget-conscious buyers or first-time audiophiles.

🪴 For Budding Enthusiasts

###### 🪴 For Budding Enthusiasts

  

In my experience, discovering good audio gear early on is a bit like tasting great coffee for the first time — once you've had a sip, you're hooked. "For Budding Enthusiasts" is a badge we use for products that are perfect gateways into the audiophile world. They're easy to use, not overly expensive, and give you a real taste of what good sound can be — without needing a degree in audio engineering. 🎧

  

These are the IEMs, headphones, and DACs that let you dip your toes into premium sound without drowning in choices. They balance performance, price, and practicality beautifully. Whether you're buying your first serious pair or helping someone else start their journey, these picks deliver satisfaction straight out of the box.

  

When you see '🪴 For Budding Enthusiasts' products, expect simple setups, solid sound quality, and an easy upgrade path — perfect for your first foray into better audio.

  

🏠 For Audiophiles at Home

###### 🏠 For Audiophiles at Home

  

I’ve always loved the ritual of coming home, settling into my favourite chair, and firing up a dedicated setup. Gear labelled For Audiophiles at Home is made for those moments — when you can really sit back and appreciate music in its purest form 🛋️. These products tend to be more powerful, larger, and often require wall power — perfect for a stationary rig.

  

Here’s the trade-off: these setups often involve external DACs, amps, or full-size headphones, which means more space, more power, but also more immersive listening. They shine when used in quiet environments, where detail, depth, and dynamics can truly be appreciated.

  

When you see '🏠 For Audiophiles at Home' products, expect: exceptional fidelity, stronger output, and the kind of soundstage that makes you never want to leave your listening chair.

✂️ Use Wirelessly with Bluetooth

###### ✂️ Use Wirelessly with Bluetooth

  

I tend to describe Bluetooth audio as wireless freedom with fewer strings attached — literally. When you see Use Wirelessly with Bluetooth, it means you can pair your headphones or IEMs with phones, laptops, or even TVs — all without reaching for a cable 🎶. It’s convenient, clutter-free, and great for everyday listening.

  

What’s happening behind the scenes is your gear is using Bluetooth codecs like SBC, AAC, LDAC, or aptX to compress and transmit your music wirelessly. Better codecs mean higher quality and lower latency. Of course, there’s a trade-off — Bluetooth won’t match the quality of wired gear, but today’s advancements have made the gap much smaller than before.

  

When you see '✂️ Use Wirelessly with Bluetooth' products, expect: tangle-free convenience and solid sound quality — great for commuting, workouts, or casual listening.

  

🔗 Connect With RCA, Optical & Coaxial

###### 🔗 Connect With Cable

  

In my experience, there’s still nothing like the dependability of a wired connection when it comes to audio 🎧. I love describing it as the direct flight of music — no delays, no turbulence. When a product says “Connect with Cable,” it means you’re getting the most reliable signal path, with zero wireless compression and minimal interference.

  

Here’s what’s actually happening: a physical cable transmits uncompressed analog or digital signals directly from your source to your gear. This results in lower latency, no signal drops, and consistently better sound — especially when paired with a good DAC or amp. It’s ideal for critical listening, gaming, and professional use. The trade-off? You’re tethered — but for a lot of audiophiles, that’s a small price to pay for sonic purity.

  

When you see '🔗 Connect With Cable' products, expect: pure, uninterrupted sound quality that lets your gear perform at its full potential — perfect for focused, high-fidelity listening.

Why it Sounds Amazing

⚙️ DAC Chip: ESS Sabre ES9023

###### ⚙️ DAC Chip

  

I like to say the DAC chip is the heart of any audio device — it’s the part that actually transforms digital files into music you can hear 🎧. Think of it like a chef decoding a recipe to create a delicious meal. The better the DAC chip, the more faithfully it translates your music. And in my experience, a great DAC can completely change how your headphones sound.

  

Now, here’s what’s actually happening: a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) takes digital signals (your MP3s, FLACs, or streams) and converts them into an analog waveform your ears can enjoy. Different DAC chips — like those from ESS, AKM, or Cirrus Logic — offer their own sound signatures, levels of clarity, and noise performance. A good DAC ensures accurate timing, minimal distortion, and exceptional resolution.

  

When you see '⚙️ DAC Chip' products, expect: clean, detailed audio and better synergy with high-quality headphones — perfect for anyone upgrading from average sound to audiophile quality.

🔬 Decodes upto 24bit/192kHz

###### 🔬 Decodes Upto

  

When I see "Decodes up to" listed in product specs, I think of it like a music translator that speaks more languages than you’ll ever need. It tells you how far a DAC or audio device can go in handling hi-res formats—think PCM, DSD, or MQA—and at what resolution. 🧠🎶

  

Technically, this refers to the maximum bit depth and sample rate a DAC can process—like 32-bit/768kHz PCM or DSD512. The higher these numbers, the more detailed and lifelike the audio can potentially sound. But remember, real-world improvements depend on the recording quality and your headphones, not just specs alone.

###### Audiophile Community Favourite

  

When I see a product that keeps coming up in forums, Reddit threads, and community meet-ups, I know it’s earned its place. "Audiophile Community Favourite" is our way of spotlighting the gear that real listeners — not just reviewers — swear by. 🦋

  

These are products that enjoy a sort of cult following for all the right reasons: consistently great tuning, build, and value. They're the kind of recommendations you'd get from a friend deep in the hobby. If you're the type who likes going with a proven crowd-pleaser, these picks are beloved by thousands of ears.

  

When you see '🦋 Audiophile Community Favourite' products, expect reliable recommendations backed by passionate users, often refined over years of trust and love from the community.

  * 🚀 

###### Power Output

  

I like to think of power output in audio gear like engine horsepower, it determines how much muscle your setup really has 💪. Whether you’re trying to drive a pair of power-hungry planar headphones or just want headroom for dynamic peaks, power output is the spec you want to check first.

  

Technically, it refers to the amount of electrical power (measured in mW or Watts) an amp or DAC/Amp combo can deliver to your headphones. More power means better control, improved dynamics, and the ability to handle demanding gear without distortion. But more isn’t always better, too much power with sensitive IEMs can introduce hiss or harshness.

  

When you see '🚀 Power Output' products, expect: strong driving capability, better dynamics, and optimal performance with headphones that need serious juice to shine.

  

  * ⚖️ 

###### Balanced Output

  

I often say balanced output is like using both hands to carry something heavy — it distributes power evenly and keeps things stable. In audio gear, balanced output helps reduce unwanted noise and interference, especially over longer cables. Think of it as a cleaner, more efficient way to transmit your music, ideal for anyone using high-end DACs, amps, or studio-grade headphones 🎧. You’ll typically find it on gear with XLR or 4.4mm connectors, and it's a must-have if you’re chasing that ultra-clean signal path.

  

Here’s what’s actually happening: a balanced output uses two separate signals, one inverted, so when interference is picked up along the cable, it gets cancelled out when the signals are recombined. The result? Cleaner audio, better dynamic range, and more power output — especially when paired with balanced headphones. The trade-off? You’ll need gear that supports balanced connections on both ends to really enjoy the benefits.

  

When you see '⚖️ Balanced Output' products, expect: ultra-low noise, more headroom, and better synergy with high-impedance headphones or sensitive IEMs — ideal for serious listening setups.

This device excels in BlueTooth (BT). The sound is quite astonishing for an unwired device. The DAC leaves a lot to be desired though. It doesn't have the warmth or the nuances of the BT connection and is quite disappointing in that respect. I'd give it a 9/10 for BT and 5 on 10 for the DAC.
