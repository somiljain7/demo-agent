##### What does Unboxed mean?

Unboxed units are as good as new products with the product's packaging being unavailable. These products give you the same satisfaction of new products - but at down-to-earth prices. Usually, the product's packaging may have gotten damaged in transit. Customers use a product once or twice and then return it with opened up packaging.

###### What does "ships within 24/48 hours" mean?

In a nutshell, ships within 24/48 hours basically means that your product will be shipped out or dispatched from our warehouse within 24/48 hours after placing the order. It also indicates that the products are readily available at our warehouse and once we receive your order, we dispatch it out at the earliest either on the same day or the next working day depending on when you’ve placed your order.

  

###### What it does not mean:

A lot of our customers assume that it means their order will get delivered to them within 24/48 hours, but that’s not what it means. For an order to reach you, it can take anywhere up to 3-4 business days, depending on which part of India you are placing an order from.

Why 7HZ is Special

I tend to describe specialist manufacturers as "audio artisans" who focus exclusively on perfecting specific categories of equipment.

Why we love this IEM

I believe in giving you complete freedom to customise your listening experience. These IEMs feature detachable cable systems that let you swap, upgrade, or replace cables whenever you want. Think of it like having a modular smartphone - you can upgrade individual components without replacing the whole device. Whether you're looking to improve sound quality, try different materials, or simply replace a worn cable, the choice is entirely yours.

  

The standardised upgradeable cable connection ensures compatibility with a wide range of aftermarket cables, giving you access to different sound characteristics and build qualities.

Why it Sounds Amazing

🔈 10mm Dynamic Drivers

###### 🔈 Dynamic Driver

  

The dynamic powerhouse of your sound ⚡!

  

I believe dynamic drivers are like the "reliable workhorses" of the headphone world - they've been perfected over decades and continue to deliver incredible performance. This driver design uses a lightweight diaphragm attached to a voice coil suspended within a permanent magnetic field, enabling precise and responsive movement that produces sound with remarkable efficiency. Think of them like precision engines that convert electrical energy into acoustic energy with impressive power and naturalness.

  

Dynamic drivers excel at delivering powerful and authoritative bass reproduction, clear midrange frequencies, and vibrant high frequencies. The inherent strengths ensure your music is reproduced with impressive dynamics and energy that stays true to the artist's intent 🎶.

  

When you see "🔈 Dynamic Driver" products, expect energetic, natural sound with excellent dynamics that bring every note and beat to life with exceptional realism.

🧈 Warm & Smooth Sound Signature

###### 🧈 Warm & Smooth Sound Signature

  

I tend to describe a warm & smooth sound signature as the audio equivalent of a hot cup of tea on a rainy day—comforting, rich, and easy to love. It's perfect for those who prefer relaxed, fatigue-free listening that doesn’t stab you with harsh highs or overly clinical detail. ☕🎶

  

Technically, this means a slightly elevated bass and lower midrange, with tamed treble to prevent any sharpness. The result is a sound that's full-bodied and inviting, especially great for vocals, jazz, indie, and old-school rock. While it may not offer extreme precision, it excels in musicality and emotional warmth, making long sessions an absolute pleasure.

💣 Kickass Bass

###### 💣 Thick Bass / Kickass Bass

  

When I say kickass bass, I’m talking about bass that slaps you right in the face—in the best way possible. It’s that visceral, chest-thumping low-end that makes you feel like you’re in the front row of a concert or a nightclub. If you’re into hip-hop, EDM, Bollywood beats, or anything with a deep groove, this is where the fun begins. 🔊💥

  

Here’s what’s going on technically: the low-frequency range is heavily emphasised, resulting in powerful sub-bass rumble and impactful mid-bass slam. This kind of tuning brings weight, warmth, and physicality to your music. The trade-off? It might mask some midrange detail or high-frequency sparkle—but for bassheads, the emotional payoff is more than worth it.

🍿 Crisp Vocals & Instruments

###### 🍿 Crisp Vocals & Instruments

  

Vocals and instruments sound so good, it's like a warm hug 🤗!

  

I believe that when vocals are reproduced correctly, they should feel like the artist is performing right there with you. These headphones demonstrate exceptional prowess in reproducing clear, articulate vocals and instruments, with each element rendered in stunning detail and separation. Think of it like having front-row seats to an intimate acoustic performance where every breath, every string resonance, every subtle inflection comes through perfectly.

  

The natural timbre and tonal accuracy create an engaging presentation where every nuance is preserved while maintaining fatigue-free listening. Each word, note, and subtle inflection is reproduced with outstanding definition and emotional connection 🎤.

  
When you encounter "🍿 Crisp Vocals & Instruments" products, expect vocal excellence that brings you closer to the emotional heart of every performance. 

🍦 Smooth & Sweet Treble

###### 🍦 Smooth & Sweet Treble

  

Seeking something that sounds smooth and devoid of harshness 🥰? I tend to describe these headphones as having "silk-like highs" that caress your ears rather than assault them. These products are meticulously designed to deliver high frequencies that are wonderfully gentle, offering a listening experience that's both sophisticated and delightful. Think of it like the difference between premium chocolate and cheap candy - both are sweet, but one provides refined pleasure while the other can be overwhelming.

  

The carefully tuned treble presentation ensures musical details come through with remarkable clarity while maintaining natural, fatigue-free character. The refined high-frequency presentation maintains excellent detail and air while avoiding any hint of harshness or stridency ✨.

  

When you see "🍦 Smooth & Sweet Treble" products, expect refined high frequencies that deliver crisp detail with a touch of sweetness and sophistication.

🍰 Layered and Nuanced Sound

###### 🍰 Layered and Nuanced Sound

  

Imagine sitting in the second row of a grand music hall 🎼, where each instrument's placement creates a vivid sonic landscape before you. I believe these headphones recreate that precise spatial positioning, allowing you to distinctly perceive where each instrument would be on an imaginary stage. Think of it like watching an orchestra conductor - you can follow each section independently while appreciating how they work together in perfect harmony. The layered presentation ensures every element occupies its own distinct space while contributing to the whole.

  

This audio equipment creates a detailed listening experience where musical notes, overtones, and reverberations shine through clearly, keeping complex passages distinct and well-separated. The tuning excels at revealing subtle interplay between instruments and the natural ambiance of recording spaces 🎯.

  

When you see "🍰 Layered and Nuanced Sound" products, expect intricate soundscapes that reveal the depth, complexity, and artistry in your favorite music with exceptional clarity.

🔍 Perfect to Analyse Music

###### 🔍 Perfect to Analyse Music

  

Delve deeper into intricate musical layers 🎼!

  

I believe that some headphones are like musical microscopes - they reveal details and nuances that most people never even know exist in their favourite songs. These specialised audio tools are meticulously engineered for those who seek to explore the deepest intricacies of sound, offering exceptional precision for detailed music analysis. Think of them as detective tools for music that help you uncover every hidden element in complex compositions.

  

These products enable you to dissect and examine every aspect of the musical landscape, from subtle instrument textures to precise timing, from delicate vocal overtones to intricate harmonic layering. They're specifically crafted for musicians, producers, and discerning audiophiles who desire profound insights into technical and artistic elements 🔬.

  

When you encounter "🔍 Perfect to Analyse Music" products, expect analytical precision that reveals layers of detail and musical craftsmanship you never knew existed.

🥃 Perfect to Layback & Relax

###### 🥃 Perfect to Layback & Relax

  

In my experience, a laid-back sound is like sinking into your favorite armchair after a long day. It doesn’t push details in your face or try to overwhelm you with energy. Instead, it gives your music room to breathe and unfold naturally. Think of it like sipping a glass of smooth whisky—there’s warmth, body, and ease. These headphones or IEMs are ideal for those who want to unwind and soak in a mellow vibe, whether it's a jazz trio or acoustic singer-songwriter set. 🎧

  

Now, what’s actually happening here is a tuning that gently rolls off the treble and offers a warm, full low-end. The midrange stays intimate, while bass adds comfort without punch, and highs avoid fatigue, making long sessions a pleasure. You won’t get maximum detail or separation—but that’s the point. It’s not about dissecting the mix—it’s about relaxing into it. For bedtime listening or just zoning out, this is your sonic hammock. 😌

What are the main differences between the 7HZ Salnotes Zero and the 7HZ x Crinacle Zero: 2?

The Zero: 2 retains the original perfect sound signature while enhancing bass frequencies by 3dB, delivering an immersive and powerful bass experience. The improved bass impact and extension add texture and tactile sensation to low frequencies. The midrange benefits from body and warmth, creating a fuller sound without sacrificing clarity. These tonal improvements are achieved through a newly developed 10mm dual cavity dynamic driver with an upgraded PU+Metal composite diaphragm, ensuring faster diaphragm movement for impactful bass and precise notes. The frequency range spans 10Hz to 20kHz, showcasing the driver's noticeable improvements. The Zero: 2 introduces a high-purity OFC cable with silver plating, featuring a coaxial structure with 140.06 and 250.06 winding for durability and enhanced audio transmission. The detachable cable allows you to customize your listening experience and prolongs the IEM's lifespan.

How does the enhanced tonal prowess of the 7HZ x Crinacle Zero: 2 contribute to the listening experience?

The 7HZ x Crinacle Zero: 2's 10mm dynamic driver with a PU+Metal composite diaphragm ensures heightened responsiveness, resulting in punchier bass, clarity, and precision. The extended frequency range from 10Hz to 20kHz highlights the impactful improvements in the audio technology.

How does the upgraded cable enhance the overall audio experience of the 7HZ x Crinacle Zero: 2?

The 7HZ x Crinacle Zero: 2 features an upgraded high-purity oxygen-free copper cable with silver plating and a coaxial structure. The intricate weaving of each wire ensures superior audio transmission. The detachable cable allows for personalized listening experiences and prolongs the IEM's longevity.

Can the cable of the 7HZ x Crinacle Zero: 2 be replaced, and what benefits does the detachable feature offer?

Yes, the 7HZ x Crinacle Zero: 2 features a detachable high-purity oxygen-free copper cable. The detachable feature allows users to customize their listening experiences and extends the overall longevity of the in-ear monitor.

How do I use these IEMs if my phone doesn't have a 3.5mm output?

If your phone doesn't have a 3.5mm output, you can use a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter for android phones or a Lightning to 3.5mm adapter for Apple iPhones to connect the 7HZ x Crinacle Zero: 2 IEMs. Alternatively, the best-sounding option is to go for a USB Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) to connect your IEMs. A good DAC makes a considerable difference to the overall sound of your set up and these DACs are highly capable and outperform inexpensive adapters. If you are looking for the best presentation of your music then a dedicated USB DAC is the way to go.

Do I really need a Digital To Analog Converter (DAC) or Amplifier to use these?

You don't necessarily need a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) or Amplifiers to use the 7HZ x Crinacle Zero: 2 IEMs, as they can be plugged directly into the 3.5mm output of your smartphones, tablets or laptops. They usually have enough power to drive these Earphones. However, using a dedicated DAC can improve the overall sound quality and provide a more detailed reproduction, especially if you are listening to Lossless or Hi-Res music.

###### Balanced Sound Signature

  

In my experience, a balanced sound signature is like a well-cooked meal—nothing overpowering, everything in harmony. If you’re someone who listens to a bit of everything—rock one day, jazz the next—this is the tuning I’d recommend. It doesn’t boost any part of the sound unnaturally, so what you hear is often how the artist intended it. 🎧

  

Here’s what’s actually happening: the headphones don’t favour bass, mids, or treble excessively. This results in a neutral, natural, and versatile sound that suits a wide variety of music genres. While it may not feel as “exciting” as some more coloured tunings, balanced headphones tend to offer the most accurate reproduction, making them a favourite among audiophiles and studio pros alike.

  * 🍿 

###### Crisp Vocals & Instruments

  

Vocals and instruments sound so good, it's like a warm hug !

  

I believe that when vocals are reproduced correctly, they should feel like the artist is performing right there with you. These headphones demonstrate exceptional prowess in reproducing clear, articulate vocals and instruments, with each element rendered in stunning detail and separation. Think of it like having front-row seats to an intimate acoustic performance where every breath, every string resonance, every subtle inflection comes through perfectly.

  

The natural timbre and tonal accuracy create an engaging presentation where every nuance is preserved while maintaining fatigue-free listening. Each word, note, and subtle inflection is reproduced with outstanding definition and emotional connection 🎤.

  
When you encounter "🍿 Crisp Vocals & Instruments" products, expect vocal excellence that brings you closer to the emotional heart of every performance.

###### Ultra-Wide Sound stage

  

Do you wish to bring the concert hall to your ears 🏛️?

  

I love describing ultra-wide soundstage as "audio magic" that creates a breathtaking three-dimensional environment around your head. These specialised headphones feature an exceptionally spacious soundstage that creates the illusion you're sitting in the sweet spot of a magnificent performance venue. Think of it like teleportation technology for your ears - suddenly you're not wearing headphones, you're sitting in Carnegie Hall with perfect acoustics.

  

The precise instrument placement and remarkable sense of space work together to transport you directly into the music, making you feel as though you're experiencing a live performance. This creates a listening experience that's grand, enveloping, and incredibly detailed 🎭.

  

When you encounter "😳 Ultra-Wide Soundstage" products, expect concert hall acoustics that make you forget you're wearing headphones through sheer spaciousness and realism.

###### Great to Get Pumped Up

  

I’ve always said the right pair of headphones can fire you up faster than a shot of espresso. When I label something as “Great to Get Pumped Up,” I’m talking about gear that’s built for impact. Think of it like stepping into a turbocharged car—the bass hits hard, the treble is energetic, and the soundstage feels intense and alive. Whether you're smashing a workout, heading into a game, or just trying to shake off a long day, this sound signature delivers the adrenaline rush.

  

Technically, it’s a mix of a boosted low-end, sparkly highs, and tight mids that bring out the crunch in guitars, the slam in kick drums, and the snap in snares. These are headphones that thrive on pop, EDM, hip-hop, and metal—any genre that wants to punch you in the chest and keep your foot tapping. Just don’t expect subtlety; this is all about fun, speed, and emotional lift. ⚡

###### Flat Sound Signature

  

I tend to describe a flat sound signature as the “studio monitor” of headphones—what goes in is what comes out. 🎚️ There’s no added flavour or colouration; it’s a true-to-source representation. Audiophiles and sound engineers who value neutrality and precision often gravitate toward this kind of tuning.

  

Here’s what’s actually happening: the entire frequency response is tuned to be as even as possible, so bass, mids, and treble are all balanced without any emphasis. This makes flat-sounding gear ideal for critical listening, mixing, or mastering, where accuracy matters more than excitement. But for casual listeners, it might feel a bit “boring.” That said, a well-done flat tuning can reveal the soul of a song like no other. 🎧

I believe that detail retrieval is like having audio superpowers - suddenly, you hear things in familiar songs that you never knew existed. These premium headphones are meticulously engineered to deliver remarkably detailed and precise sound reproduction, capturing every subtle nuance with exceptional accuracy. Think of them like high-resolution cameras for your ears that reveal the finest textures and micro-details that most headphones simply miss.

  

The carefully tuned drivers and advanced acoustic design ensure even the most delicate musical elements are reproduced with stunning precision. From the gentle brush of a cymbal to the subtle resonance of acoustic instruments, these products capture and present every sonic detail with remarkable accuracy 🎯.

###### Layered and Nuanced Sound

  

Imagine sitting in the second row of a grand music hall 🎼, where each instrument's placement creates a vivid sonic landscape before you. I believe these headphones recreate that precise spatial positioning, allowing you to distinctly perceive where each instrument would be on an imaginary stage. Think of it like watching an orchestra conductor - you can follow each section independently while appreciating how they work together in perfect harmony. The layered presentation ensures every element occupies its own distinct space while contributing to the whole.

  

This audio equipment creates a detailed listening experience where musical notes, overtones, and reverberations shine through clearly, keeping complex passages distinct and well-separated. The tuning excels at revealing subtle interplay between instruments and the natural ambiance of recording spaces 🎯.

###### Perfect to Layback & Relax

  

In my experience, a laid-back sound is like sinking into your favorite armchair after a long day. It doesn’t push details in your face or try to overwhelm you with energy. Instead, it gives your music room to breathe and unfold naturally. Think of it like sipping a glass of smooth whisky—there’s warmth, body, and ease. These headphones or IEMs are ideal for those who want to unwind and soak in a mellow vibe, whether it's a jazz trio or acoustic singer-songwriter set. 🎧

  

Now, what’s actually happening here is a tuning that gently rolls off the treble and offers a warm, full low-end. The midrange stays intimate, while bass adds comfort without punch, and highs avoid fatigue, making long sessions a pleasure. You won’t get maximum detail or separation—but that’s the point. It’s not about dissecting the mix—it’s about relaxing into it. For bedtime listening or just zoning out, this is your sonic hammock. 😌

###### Warm & Smooth Sound Signature

  

I tend to describe a warm & smooth sound signature as the audio equivalent of a hot cup of tea on a rainy day—comforting, rich, and easy to love. It's perfect for those who prefer relaxed, fatigue-free listening that doesn’t stab you with harsh highs or overly clinical detail. ☕🎶

  

Technically, this means a slightly elevated bass and lower midrange, with tamed treble to prevent any sharpness. The result is a sound that's full-bodied and inviting, especially great for vocals, jazz, indie, and old-school rock. While it may not offer extreme precision, it excels in musicality and emotional warmth, making long sessions an absolute pleasure.

When I say kickass bass, I’m talking about bass that slaps you right in the face—in the best way possible. It’s that visceral, chest-thumping low-end that makes you feel like you’re in the front row of a concert or a nightclub. If you’re into hip-hop, EDM, Bollywood beats, or anything with a deep groove, this is where the fun begins. 🔊💥

  

Here’s what’s going on technically: the low-frequency range is heavily emphasised, resulting in powerful sub-bass rumble and impactful mid-bass slam. This kind of tuning brings weight, warmth, and physicality to your music. The trade-off? It might mask some midrange detail or high-frequency sparkle—but for bassheads, the emotional payoff is more than worth it.

###### Smooth & Sweet Treble

  

Seeking something that sounds smooth and devoid of harshness 🥰? I tend to describe these headphones as having "silk-like highs" that caress your ears rather than assault them. These products are meticulously designed to deliver high frequencies that are wonderfully gentle, offering a listening experience that's both sophisticated and delightful. Think of it like the difference between premium chocolate and cheap candy - both are sweet, but one provides refined pleasure while the other can be overwhelming.

  

The carefully tuned treble presentation ensures musical details come through with remarkable clarity while maintaining natural, fatigue-free character. The refined high-frequency presentation maintains excellent detail and air while avoiding any hint of harshness or stridency ✨.

  

When you see "🍦 Smooth & Sweet Treble" products, expect refined high frequencies that deliver crisp detail with a touch of sweetness and sophistication.

###### Layered and Nuanced Sound

  

Imagine sitting in the second row of a grand music hall 🎼, where each instrument's placement creates a vivid sonic landscape before you. I believe these headphones recreate that precise spatial positioning, allowing you to distinctly perceive where each instrument would be on an imaginary stage. Think of it like watching an orchestra conductor - you can follow each section independently while appreciating how they work together in perfect harmony. The layered presentation ensures every element occupies its own distinct space while contributing to the whole.

  

This audio equipment creates a detailed listening experience where musical notes, overtones, and reverberations shine through clearly, keeping complex passages distinct and well-separated. The tuning excels at revealing subtle interplay between instruments and the natural ambiance of recording spaces 🎯.

  

When you see "🍰 Layered and Nuanced Sound" products, expect intricate soundscapes that reveal the depth, complexity, and artistry in your favorite music with exceptional clarity.

**Sounds beautiful**

It sounds very pleasant, any genre u can enjoy on this iem. I like bass to be present when it needs to hit and this iem produces it very well and that too not at the cost of affecting any other frequency like vocals. It brought a smile on my face need i say more? ...also it helped me revive from my sins of listening to muffled bassy earphones in the past like sony xb 55 , kz zex etc and helped me move on from them. In my opinion this is better than chu 2 as the bass and sound profile is kind of boxy in chu 2 whereas zero2 produces wider soundstage and overal better music. Need to thank headphone zone for having detailed description and product reviews on youtube which helped me make this purchase decision.

**Undoubtedly Great**

This review comes from someone who isn't an audiophile and has never tried IEMs. Using these was an "ear-opening" experience because I heard sounds I didn't know existed. This happened after I managed to find the correct ear tips for my ears and getting the ear tips on the IEMs was the hardest part (it took me a whole hour and help from my friend).

This isn't a sponsored review, but I want to thank Headphone Zone for introducing and marketing IEMs to the general Indian public. Because I can experience superior music quality, of what is available in this price segment (the wireless earbuds).

The new headset is very good. I like it since I’ve been using a tangzu warner, a saltnotes zero and this new zero 2, I think the saltnotes zero 2 is more clear and have more base. I also have an issue with my tangzu warner . I am using tangzu since may 2024 but now the left ear piece is not working and the warranty period is over also can you please do something for this
