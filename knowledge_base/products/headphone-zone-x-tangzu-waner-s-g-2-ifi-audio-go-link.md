###### GET 18% GST INPUT

All products sold on Headphone Zone carry a GST compliant invoice and all products sold include an 18% GST.  
  
Simply enter your GST number at the time of checkout.

##### What does Unboxed mean?

Unboxed units are as good as new products with the product's packaging being unavailable. These products give you the same satisfaction of new products - but at down-to-earth prices. Usually, the product's packaging may have gotten damaged in transit. Customers use a product once or twice and then return it with opened up packaging.
