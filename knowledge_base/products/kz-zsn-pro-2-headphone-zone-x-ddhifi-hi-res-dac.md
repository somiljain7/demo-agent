Unboxed units are as good as new products with the product's packaging being unavailable. These products give you the same satisfaction of new products - but at down-to-earth prices. Usually, the product's packaging may have gotten damaged in transit. Customers use a product once or twice and then return it with opened up packaging.

**KZ ZSN PRO 2 + Headphone Zone X ddHiFi Hi-Res DAC IEM Bundle Review**

This IEM and DAC bundle brings together the KZ ZSN PRO 2, known for its V-shaped sound signature, and the Headphone Zone X ddHiFi Hi-Res DAC, designed to elevate audio quality. The punchy bass and sparkling highs of the ZSN PRO 2 make music feel lively, while its clear vocals and detailed instruments ensure an immersive listening experience.

Pairing it with the Hi-Res DAC enhances the overall sound, offering better clarity, improved dynamics, and a cleaner audio signal. The DAC helps refine the bass response and smoothens the highs, making the listening experience even more enjoyable. Whether you're a casual listener or an audiophile on a budget, this bundle is an excellent choice for getting the most out of your music.

**Amazing IEM**

It's an amazing IEM. Crystal clear sound. I like it's clean mid, not overwhelming but quality bass thumps, and treble. Every single note can be heard distinctly, it never gets overlapped or distorted. One thing is that this IEM might get sharp for treble sensitive people and has sibilance. But any equalizer does worders for it and its treble is high, but it's clean & distinct. I personally have reduced it treble to my liking.   
All in all, I love this IEM. Every single sound, let it be vocal or instrument sounds so clean and crisp.

**KZ ZSN Pro 2 + DdHIFI DAC**

ddHiFi DAC is must if you want to enhance any earphones output.   
KZ ZSN Pro2 Earphone is ok-ish.   
Now understood why DAC is more expensive than earphones.   
Sometimes the earphones volume is bit sharp which may hurt ears in prolong use.   
Maybe was expecting more due to hammering advertisements.

Thanks a lot for your review! We appreciate your genuine feedback.
