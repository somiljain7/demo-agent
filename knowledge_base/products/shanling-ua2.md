**Value for money**

hey this is my first time using a DAC, but i can say this is quite amazing. I've bought unboxed one rather than new. I've paired them with CCA-PLA13 and they together do the job. I'm using my mac for listening and first it is difficult for me to adjust the sampling frequency and you can do that by accessing Audio MIDI Setup in applications folder and select the DAC you've attached and select the required there. Trust me you can feel a lot of difference when compared to your regular ones. I am using airpods pro for regular listening and I can feel a lot of difference here, you can hear every detail of the song. Its worth a try for beginning of your journey. Planning to have a balanced cable soon as this also supports 2.5mm output.

**Where have you been all my life?**

This review comes from someone who has never used an external DAC. I might sound extremely biased as this is my first experience but I swear to God listening through this got me to write down this review. 

From my teenage years I would always invest in decent headphones and earbuds from Sennheiser. So I know the importance of good headphones to get a good music experience. It's been a year since I owned a   
Sennheiser CX 300S and a HD 598 SE. I thought Music could never have been better but boy was I wrong, Shanking UA2 has completely brought a new listening experience. Apart from the sound clarity and volume amplification. I could notice I do not get fatigued listening for hours. There's something about Shanling UA2 that gives you a warm heavenly feeling. I would definitely recommend this to someone who would want to get started on their DAC journey. The same song I have listened to forever got me feeling like my first experience!

**Superb DAC from Shanling**

This is my 2nd DAC. Previously I was using Venture Electronics Odyssey. There is a huge difference in detailing, sound stage, depth, resolution and sound signature. I just love to hear music, watch movies movies and play games with this UA2. Thanks to Headphone Gurus for helping me out in choosing the right product which will make a perfect pair with the KZ ZAS IEM.

**Worthy upgrade**

If you are coming from no Dac, this is a worthy upgrade. I am using this with Blon Bl-03 and it has boosted his performance to a whole another level. I have used only UA1 and it performs better than that. Totally worth it.

Thanks headphonezone for the fast delivery.

**A powerful little monster**

I have never really used an audiophile headphone setup till about a week ago. But after getting a pair of hifiman planers, I chose the UA-2 to drive them. And boy am I blown away. This hardly 2-inch long amplifier adds so much life to the planers. There is more than enough headroom for amplification using the balanced 2.5 and does great justice to the dynamics of these openbacks. I am loving every bit of sound it is producing. Great buy, especially because of the cost and the size. For best results use the 2.5mm balanced output, the 3.5mm sounds good, but does not have the same amplification headroom.

**Simply Brilliant**

I was very skeptical about making this purchase at first so I went for the 'Talk to a Headphone Guru' option. On the same day I got a call from Mr. Raghav Somani himself. It was kind of a fanboy moment for me since I've seen his videos on YouTube and I really enjoyed them. We had a very insightful chat about the different products available and I was given some suggestions based on my budget, personal requirements & usage. I purchased the Shanling UA2 to go with my KZ ZSN Pro X which I was already enjoying to the fullest. I found it a bit tricky to get the most out of the DAC at first but after a few rounds of trial and error I was about to figure out how to play audio with higher bit-rate without it being down-sampled by the Operating System. The status LED was super-helpful to identify if I'm doing it right. This was on my Linux machine. On windows it was pretty much just plug and play :)

The start of my audiophile journey has been exciting and I look forward to a long standing relationship with Headphone Zone.

###### DAC Chip

You may not even realise it, but most of us use a digital-to-analogue converter (commonly known as a DAC) daily. Built into your computers, tablets and smartphones, a DAC is fundamental to unlocking the convenience of digital music. Any device that acts as a digital sound source will need a DAC to convert digital audio to analog. A DAC converts the digital information stored in “0s and 1s” into an analog signal that's passed to speakers or headphones and ultimately our ear. In short, DACs play a large part in making digital music hearable.  
  
While this technical process is undoubtedly impressive, the DAC embedded into your smartphones or laptops is nowhere good enough to listen to your favourite music recordings in high quality. So, if you want to listen to music in high quality, an external DAC is essential to allow headphones or speakers to perform at their potential. An external DAC, first and foremost, will improve audio quality dramatically.

Pair with Laptop via  
USB-C to USB-A adapter 

###### Pair with Laptop via USB

A majority of people use a laptop as the primary source device to listen to music or watch movies. Since the laptop is an essential part of the audio chain there are headphones and devices designed to work a laptop or computer system flawlessly. With the availability of USB connectivity, it becomes easier to pair various devices like an Amp, DAC or even headphones without worrying about drivers or any additional piece of software.

> My favourite DAC, for use on the go. It comes with a 2.5mm balanced output which is an absolute game-changer when using it with Headphones and IEMs. The soundstage widens, the bass tightens, and the details become crisper.
