## Differentiation of the Three RAG Techniques (Llama Index)

There are three Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches—**Chat Engine**, **Query Engine**, and **Retrieval Engine**—each designed for slightly different use cases within AI agents that use Llama Index.

| Feature                   | Chat Engine RAG Setup                                                                  | Query Engine RAG Setup                                                                                                      | Retrieval Engine RAG Setup                                                                                                |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Core Mechanism**        | Embeds the response generation directly into the Large Language Model (LLM).           | Uses a base LLM (e.g., GPT-4o mini) to interpret the query, which then triggers a **function call** to the vector database. | Retrieves relevant data and generates a response by **selecting the first relevant answer** from the indexed nodes.       |
| **Function/Tool Calling** | **No function calling** capability. The Llama Index chat functions limit this ability. | **Supports function/tool calling**. Models like GPT-4o mini can call external tools such as CRMs or scheduling systems.     | **No function calling** is defined in its default configuration.                                                          |
| **Speed/Performance**     | Typically **fast** because all processing occurs within the LLM.                       | **Slower**, since it performs two operations: one to decide the function call and another to query the vector store.        | Not directly compared, but simplified retrieval (choosing the first answer) speeds up processing.                         |
| **Recommended Use Case**  | Ideal for creating **chatbot-style interactions**.                                     | Best suited for **AI assistants or agent-style applications** that integrate with other tools or APIs.                      | Useful for **lightweight retrieval tasks**, though it can produce less precise answers if multiple similar entries exist. |
| **Observed Limitation**   | Cannot perform dynamic actions like sending appointment links.                         | Requires multiple calls, increasing latency.                                                                                | Sometimes struggles with nuanced or restricted content, depending on dataset setup and filtering.                         |

## Integration with LiveKit

All three RAG methods can integrate with **LiveKit**, a WebRTC-based framework used for real-time AI voice and video agents.

1. **Framework Foundation:** The AI system runs on LiveKit, which provides real-time communication (voice/video) capabilities.
2. **Agent Registration:** When an AI agent starts, it **registers itself as a worker** with the LiveKit server.
3. **Client Connection:** When a user joins a room, LiveKit assigns an available worker (the AI agent) to that room for direct interaction.
4. **Retrieval Engine Specifics:** In the Retrieval Engine setup, the parameter `will_synthesize_assistant_reply` defines how the system generates responses from retrieved data before they are spoken or displayed.

## Combined Agent (Combined LLM) Concept

In some Chat Engine setups, developers experimented with a **combined LLM** design:

* The combined LLM was created using `llama_index.llm` and passed the Chat Engine, which already contained document embeddings.
* Its purpose was to **test fallback functionality**—so that if the Chat Engine failed, a standard model like GPT-4o mini could take over.
* This design is **not required** for all RAG setups; it’s an optional approach for improving reliability or testing hybrid configurations.

## Tool Calling and Agent Callables

The **Query Engine** setup benefits from using LLMs that support **tool calling**. This enables the agent to perform various actions, such as:

* Querying a vector database to fetch relevant information.
* Interacting with a CRM system to retrieve or update customer data.
* Sending an appointment link via external services like Twilio.

This makes the Query Engine ideal for building intelligent assistants capable of executing real-world actions, not just responding conversationally.
